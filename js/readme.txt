maybe you can take a look at the last section of the game.js

now it compares the strings and set points, but only when the string is
3 items long. everything more is not recognized.

is there a way to change the logical operator that it can compare the whole string or do i have to write a whole new function?

the more i am trying to think about it, the harder it gets.
